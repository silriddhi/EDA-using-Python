Enhancing Customer Experience through Exploratory Data Analysis​

 - Employing multivariate analysis, I pinpointed restaurants meeting promotional offer criteria based on rating count and average rating.​

- I recommended optimizing order delivery times, prioritizing promotional efforts for top rated restaurants, and strategically utilizing discount vouchers to enhance customer loyalty.​

- On weekdays, delivery times are quite lengthy, so I recommend that it's imperative that the company work with the delivery parties to resolve this issue.​
